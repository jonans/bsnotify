# BSnotify

Use Bambu Studio or Orca Slicer with printers outside your LAN.

Bambu Lab printers have a LAN only mode to avoid relying on cloud services for general tasks.
One limitation is that Bambu Studio can only find your printer when both are on the same LAN.
Discovery happens using SSDP but due non-standard/broken implementation it does not work when
they are on different LANs. Since BS lacks the simple ability to add printer via IP, 
SSDP is the only way.

Thats where bsnotify comes in, it will notify BS of printers outside your LAN.

Tested on Linux and Windows with P1P. 
Tested on MacOS and Linux with X1C.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Printer set to LAN only mode
- Info from your printer:
  - IP address
  - Serial Number
  - Access Code
- Run bsnotify on the same LAN as your slicer (the device running Bambu Studio).


```
python3 bsnotify <printer-ip> <printer-serial-number>
```

Optional:
Specify the source address(es) as comma separated values. This will allow for broadcasting on specific network(s) from a server or router (such as a Unifi Dream Machine) that has multiple interfaces.

```
python3 bsnotify <printer-ip> <printer-serial-number> <local address(es)>
```

By default, bsnotify generates the printer name from its serial number (`3DP-<SER>-<IAL>`).
You can override this name with your own name:

```
python3 bsnotify <printer-ip> <printer-serial-number> <local address(es)> <printer-name>
```

## The Details

- Printer SSDP server does not seem to respond to SEARCH requests in any format.
- Printer periodically sends out the following NOTIFYs :
  - to 255.255.255.255:2021  - BS responds to this
  - to 239.255.255.250:1990  - BS ignores this
- BS sends out SEARCH requests but never gets a reply.
- This script spoofs the multicast response from the printer but on the network that you're using for Bambu Studio. Even if you add the device manually, Bambu Studio still expects this multicast packet.

## Optional: Installing as a service on linux 
Git clone, scp, copy-paste, etc. bsnotify.py to /etc/bsnotify (or whatever filepath you want, but make sure to specify in the service file)

Create a file /etc/systemd/system/bsnotify.service (fill in the values for the command)

```
[Unit]
Description=BSNotify Service to enable Bambu Studio across VLANs

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=python3 /etc/bsnotify/bsnotify <printer-ip> <printer-serial-number> <local address(es)>

Run
```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable bsnotify.service
systemctl restart bsnotify.service 
systemctl status bsnotify.service
```
